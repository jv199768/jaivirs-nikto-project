On Kali Linux, you can find memory leaks using system monitoring tools and dedicated debugging programs like Valgrind. To uninstall Nikto, use the standard apt package manager commands. 
How to find memory leaks on Kali Linux
1. Use system monitoring tools
For a quick, real-time look at memory consumption, start with these standard Linux tools:
top and htop: These commands show all running processes and their resource usage. In top, press M to sort by memory usage. htop offers a more user-friendly, color-coded interface and is a better choice for identifying which processes are consuming the most memory over time.
smem: This tool provides a more detailed breakdown of memory usage, including shared and proportional memory. This can be useful for understanding how memory is distributed across processes.
To install: sudo apt install smem
To run: smem -r -k 
2. Analyze a specific process using /proc
If you suspect a specific process is leaking memory, you can examine its entry in the /proc filesystem. 
Find the process ID (PID) of the application using ps aux | grep <process_name> or htop.
Capture its initial memory map: cat /proc/<PID>/smaps > before.txt
Allow the process to run for a while, letting memory consumption increase.
Capture the memory map again: cat /proc/<PID>/smaps > after.txt
Compare the two files using diff to find which memory ranges have grown. 
3. Use Valgrind for detailed debugging
For in-depth analysis of a running program, Valgrind is the standard tool for detecting memory leaks and memory management errors in C/C++ applications. 
Install Valgrind: sudo apt update && sudo apt install valgrind
Run your program with leak checking: valgrind --leak-check=full ./your_program
Analyze the output: Valgrind will generate a detailed report showing any memory that was allocated but not freed, including the call stack where the leak originated. 
How to uninstall Nikto
Nikto is a standard package in Kali Linux, so it can be uninstalled using the apt package manager. 
Remove Nikto: Use the following command to remove the Nikto package.
bash
sudo apt remove nikto
Purge configuration files: To remove all associated configuration files as well, use the purge option.
bash
sudo apt purge nikto
Remove unused dependencies: After uninstalling, remove any packages that were installed with Nikto but are no longer needed by other programs.
bash
sudo apt autoremove
Clean the package cache: This command removes the downloaded Nikto installer files from your system.
bash
sudo apt clean
